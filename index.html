<p>This audio needs to be put into a spectrogram!</p>
<p>You can download the audio with the fancy button, although I was having problems trying to get it to work on my end. If the download isn't working for you, go to my GitHub page (hahafunny11) and download it from the repository named "spectro"!</p>
<p>I highly recommend using <a href="https://nsspot.herokuapp.com/imagetoaudio/">this spectrogram</a>, as it's the one that I found that works the best. Press "Browse..." and upload this audio file!</p>
